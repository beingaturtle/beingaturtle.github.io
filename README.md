# COMM 2216 User Documentation: Exploring myBCIT Essentials
Welcome to BCIT, where your path to success begins. As a first-year student, accessing the MyBCIT website may appear overwhelming at first, but don't worry! We have prepared the three things that will help you get started in your educational journey at BCIT. In this documentation we've picked the top three tasks that will help you have a smooth experience at BCIT namely:  Getting your course schedule and setting up your BCIT email account. Each stage is clearly outlined and paired by images to help you follow the steps easily.

To streamline the documentation process and make it as simple and intuitive as possible, we used MkDocs, a package for Python that simplifies the production of documentation in Markdown language. Through the use of this tool, we aim to give you with clear and concise instructions in an easy-to-follow style. In addition, we have taken inspiration from existing documentation which serve as a standard guide for this documentation as seen [here](https://samlee77.github.io/Sam-Test/)
